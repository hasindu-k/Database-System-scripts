--(a) A method to compute the yield of stocks: Yield is the dividend expressed as a percentage of the current 
price (yield = (dividend/current price) *100). Assume that all dividends are for a period of one year.

SELECT s.company, s.yield()
FROM stocks s

--(b) A method to compute the current price of stocks in US dollars, taking the current exchange rate of AUD to 
USD as an input parameter (assuming that the prices in the STOCKS table are in AUD).

--(c) A method to count the number of exchanges where a given stock is traded.

--2. Answer the following queries on STOCKS and CLIENTS tables. Use methods wherever possible.

--(a) Get the yield of all stocks along with their current prices in US dollars, given an exchange rate of 0.74 USD 
to an AUD. Display the name of the stock, the exchanges where the stock is traded, the stockâ€™s yield and 
the price in USD.

select s.company, e.column_value, s.yield(), s.AUDtoUSD(0.74)
from stocks s, table(s.exchange_trade) e
/

--(b) Find the company name, current price and the number of exchanges for shares that are traded on more than 
one exchange, using one of the methods.

select s.company, s.current_price, s.no_of_trades()
from stocks s, table(s.exchange_trade) e
where s.no_of_trades() > 1
/

--(c) For each client, get the name, and the list of investments with stock name, yield, current price and earnings 
per share. Use the method for computing yield in this query.

select DISTINCT c.first_name fname, i.company.company stock, i.company.yield() yield, i.company.current_price current_price, i.company.earning earning
from clients c, table(c.investments) i
order by fname
/

--(d) Find the total purchase value of investments for all clients. Display client name and total value. Use the 
method for computing purchase value in this query.

select c.first_name fname, c.totPurchaseValue() total_value
from clients c
/

--(e) For each client, list the book profit (or loss) on the total share investment. Use the method for computing 
profit

select c.first_name fname, c.TotProfit() total_Profit
from clients c
/
