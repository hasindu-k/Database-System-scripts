--a)
For each client, get the client’s name, and the list of the client’s investments with stock name, 
current price, last dividend and earnings per share.

SELECT c.first_name client_name, i.company.company stock_name, i.company.current_price current_price, i.company.last_dividend last_dividend, i.company.earning earning
FROM clients c, TABLE(c.investments) i
/

--(b) Get the list of all clients and their share investments, showing the client name, and for each 
stock held by the client, the name of the stock, total number of shares held, and the average 
purchase price paid by the client for the stock. Average price is the total purchase value paid 
by a client for a given stock (value=qty*price) divided by the total quantity held by the client.


SELECT c.first_name client_name, i.company.company stock_name, SUM(i.qty) tot_shares , SUM(i.purchase_price*i.qty) / SUM(i.qty) average_purchase_price

GROUP BY c.first_name, i.company.company 

--(c) For each stock traded in New York, find the quantity held by each client, and its current value 
(value=qty*price). Display stock (company) name, client name, number of shares held, and the 
current value of the shares

WHERE e.column_value = 'New York'
GROUP BY c.first_name, i.company.company

--(d) Find the total purchase value of investments for all clients. Display client name and total 
purchase value of the client’s portfolio.

SELECT c.first_name, SUM(i.qty*i.purchase_price) as tot_purchase
FROM clients c, TABLE(c.investments) i

--(e) For each client, list the book profit (or loss) on the total share investment. Book profit is the 
total value of all stocks based on the current prices less the total amount paid for purchasing 
them

SELECT c.first_name, SUM( i.qty * (i.company.current_price - i.purchase_price)) as book_profit
FROM clients c, TABLE(c.investments) i

--4)Suppose John sold all his INFOSYS stocks to Jill, and 
Jill sold all her GM stocks to John today at 
the current prices. Update the database for these two transactions. Use the query 3(a) to check if the 
update worked correctly. (Here, the term update does not necessarily mean using the update 
statement of SQL.
